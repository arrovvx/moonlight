# moonlight project

This is a quick resume website


## Getting Started

Clone or download the repo

## Prerequisites

This application uses Bootstrap 3.3.5 which runs on Chrome, Firefox, Iv9+, Edge, opera, and Mac Safari. Site adjustments for mobile devices are also avaliable.

## To Run

This web application has to be hosted separately. The backend server.js host the email client api for the frontend bootstrap view. To server server.js, make sure you setup the environment variables with the email and email password. Gmail SMTP is recommended as you can setup alternative app password with two-factor authentication. If you are not using two-factor authentication, make sure to enable the less secure app setting on your google account security page. If the username and password is not accepted, make sure to unlock captcha in the link below:
```
accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
```
To load the frontend, double click index.html in the public directory or drag the file to a browser.
